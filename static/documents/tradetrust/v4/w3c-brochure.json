Examples of such documents include the negotiable Bill of Lading, Bill of Exchange, Warehouse Receipts and Promissory Notes etc. An electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) that is issued using the TradeTrust framework can be transacted by various commercial stakeholders in a fully decentralised manner, eliminating the need for all parties to be on a common digital platform."
